CS Student @ Wayne State University | Graduating 2027 | 3.54 GPA

I'm a third year student who is passionate about full-stack web development. After diving into web-dev over the past summer (outside of my school's curriculum), I discovered I love breaking down visual designs into
modular, digestible components and breathing life into my ideas through code.

Currently Building
<ul>
  <li>Interactive web applications with React</li>
  <li>Projects with a focus with clean UI/UX and practicality</li>
</ul>
