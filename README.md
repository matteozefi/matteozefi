Hi, my name is Matteo Zefi and I am currently a third year Computer Science student enrolled at Wayne State University. Im looking to pursue a career in frontend web development post-grad and from there
I could see myself pivoting into full stack or dev-ops. I am currently sitting as a 3.54 GPA and I am more than halfway done with my degree and the university experience has been very humbling to say
the least and has, if anything, solidified my love for programming and software.

As far as my programming knowledge is concerned I learned a lot of C++ from my school's CS curriculum as that is the main programming language thatthey teach to underclassmen. I would consider myself 
an intermediate C++ programmer as I am familiar with all of the basic and a lot of the more advanced syntax that the language has to offer and I've madeprojects demonstrating my intermediate expertise
such as a basic arithmetic calculator, a length, weight, and temperature unit converter as well as a hangman game that generates random numbers. As far as independent study is concerned I've been 
familiarizing and self teaching both HTML and CSS to myself and am also looking to learn Javascript and implement these skills into a plethora of personalprojects that I will then display in my own 
personal repositories. I'm so excited to keep on struggling through the process and improving as a programming to hopefully become a full fledged programmer some time in the near future.
