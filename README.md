Hi, my name is Matteo Zefi and I am currently a third year Computer Science student enrolled at Wayne State University. Im looking to pursue a career in full-stack web development post-grad. I am currently sitting as a 3.54 GPA and I am more than halfway done with my degree and the university experience has been very humbling to say
the least and has, if anything, solidified my love for programming and software. Over the summer I initiated my pivot into web development as this isn't something that is natively taught in my school's CS curriculum and this was very eye opening to say the least.
What I learned whilst studying these new concepts is that I seem to really have a knack for boiling down the visual design process into bits and pieces that I then digest and dissect into compartmentalized
sections which I then tackle in sequence. I love seeing the code I write come to life on the screen in front of me as this really ingrained within me that there is meaning behind what I'm doing. I'm essentially
creating something in which I have full creative agency and I get to actualize my ideas in any way that I so desire and this sense of digitized freedom has only reinforced the idea that this is a field suited for me. I'm always challenging
my perspective on problem solving and looking for ways to expand upon things I've previously built or use older concepts to build something entirely new as this is the beauty of web development to me. There
is always more that can be done to a web app and the techniques you use in one project will never be rendered entirely obselete as old ideas serve as the framework for creating something new entirely. All in all,
I'm ecstatic that sooner rather than later I will get to utilize these ideas in a professional setting and work alongside people to better the user experience as a whole whilst also putting my ideas to the test
on a scale that seems larger than life to an aspiring web developer such as myself.
